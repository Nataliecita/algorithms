QUESTION: Given two sequences, print longest common subsequence
LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.

LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.

PREP: Use matrix to keep track of our longest common subsequence.
Our input is trwo string and we are returning string of the longest substring
